Description

For our project, we are going to be designing a fantasy sports application. The application will allow users to register for accounts and be able to manage and participate in multiple fantasy sports teams, including football, hockey, baseball and basketball.

The way it works is that after a user has registered and logged in, they will be able to select from one of the four aforementioned sports. From there, they will be able to either manage their team in a pre-existing league or create a new league.

Users will be able to create their teams and compete against other players in a weekly competition (that spans over the entire sports season) involving player stats. The creator of the league determines which stats will be a factor in the league, and the players "draft" players that they think will excel at those specific stats. When players on your team excel in their stats, your team gets points in your league.

It's essentially a game involving player stats and other users. Player stats and pulled from an external API so no need to host them ourselves, however league, fantasy team and user information will need to be stored on a server.
